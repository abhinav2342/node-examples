This is an example of Router middleware of the express framework to create a API for routing the webpages.


For example purpose a webpage for dishes is considered and all the routing methods are used. The urls are routed to display the correct information on the local server.
One of the url contains parameter and other does not.

The public files contains all the html pages to be displayed when "/" or "/about" is called. Any other page to be displayed is to be added in the same folder.

The route file contains the routing info for the dishes url the output of these urls are logged and not displayed.

{node modules needed for express have not been commited}
